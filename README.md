**PROJECT 1(Secret Keeper)**: This C program is a simple console-based user registration and login system with basic account management functionalities. Users can register an account by providing a username, password, phone number, and a top-secret piece of information that they want to hide securly. The account information is stored in individual files named after the user's phone number with a ".elf" extension( Customizable extension).

Upon registration, the user's data is written to a file, and during login, the program prompts the user to enter their phone number and password. If the provided credentials match those stored during registration, the user is granted access, and their top-secret information is displayed.

Additionally, the program allows users to edit their top-secret information after logging in. Users can choose to edit their top-secret information, and the updated data is then written back to the file.
